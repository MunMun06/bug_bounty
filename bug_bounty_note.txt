First lesson: preparation really matter
  scoped the target. figured out what in-scope and out of scope 
Second lesson: tool are great but they don't replace understanding
  think like a user and then a developer when using the application 
  think of where this application might screw up
Third lesson: RECON 
  take note obsessively. try to understand application logic
  have a system for recon and a thorough documentation
Fourth lesson: mindset
  failure will inevitably happen. used it to learn new things about the application 
  and improve on the next target 
Fifth lesson: community 
  seeing what other found,what mistake they done, what trick they used 
  dramatically increase improvement speed 
Sixth lesson: scope creeping your own workflow
  don't chase fancy bug while ignoring what actually matter 
  focus on impact not novelty (or coolness)
seventh lesson: reporting 
  clarity matter. screenshot, step by step reproduction and concise explanation 
eighth lesson: reflection 
  after everything is done. review what work, what doesn't and what could be improve.
