dont only touch the surface 
  made an account
  use their api 
  see how authentication works
  use the upload and download function

pre-manual testing and automation
  tech profiling
    find what software the target use and what version
    webanalyze is the cli tool for this
  finding CVE's and misconfigs
    find framework login pages, default creds, anything related to non-custom code 
    nuclei is the cli tool for this (no tool is comprehensive)
      try find things that nobody found and create custom template
        automatically pull new CVE's, vuln classes, writeups not in nuclei library
      other tools include Gofingerprint Sn1per, Intrigue Core, Vulners, Jaeles Scanner, retire.js 
  port scanning 
    Naabu is the simple tool 
    RustScan is 2x-10x faster than other tools 

Content discovery
  pay special attention to
    framework and their config files (like endpoint and files that give DB config string)
  list to feed into tool 
    content-discovery-lists.png 
    https://wordlists.assetnote.io/   for more search in the "Technology <=> Host Mapping"
  feroxbuster is the tool for this (gobuster too)
  Source2URL (tools)
    to generate wordlists from OSS (ask for a demo for paid software or just paid)
  Scavenger (burp's plugin)
    create custom wordlists from word from the site 
  getallurls (gau) and wordlistgen
    create wordlist from what used to exist 
    echo bugcrowd.com | gau | wordlistgen | sort -u 
    waymore is the improved version of gau 
  recursive
    do a recursive bruteforce for 401 error
      https://app.com/admin/  401
      https://app.com/admin/dashboard/  401
      https://app.com/admin/dashboard/members  200
  mobile
    if the mobile app use api from the main domain. its in scope 
    APKleaks for android 
  stay up to date 
    target's newsletter, affiliate programs, googling conference talks
    monitor the domain for code changes with changedetection.io 

Application analysis 
  Big questions
    how does the app pass data 
    how/where does the app talk about users 
      UID,email,username,UUID    Cookies,API calls
    does the site have multi-tenancy or user levels 
      tool like authorize 
    does the site have a unique threat model 
      some custom or special attack vector
    has there been past security research and vulns 
      test the bug that is already tested and bypass the patch 
      look up on bounty platform for past history
    how does the app handle vulns classes 
      XSS SSRF CSRF IDOR XXE Shell ++ SSTI code injection
  spidering
    find all endpoints and parameters
    burpsuite or OWASP's ZAP is the tools 
    hakrawler and Gospider are cli 
  javascript
    parsing javascript for endpoints
      custom and sometimes framework ones too
    xnLinkFinder is the tool 
    use beautifier.io to undo minified or obfuscated js 
  parameter analysis  
    use gf (or gf pattern idk ) along with pattern files to find common parameter that are vulnerable to a specific vulns classes 
    lists are in parameter-analysis-lists.png  
  heat Mapping
    spidey sense type shit 
    in heat-map-mindmap.png

personal tracking
  notion    LETS GOOOOOO


watch recon video as well
